        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi Everyone! Iâ€™m Syed Sohail from Chandole, India, currently in my third year of pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Vignan's University. While coding is a significant part of my academic life, I have a rich array of hobbies and interests that keep me engaged outside the classroom. I am passionate about playing games, which offers me a blend of strategy and relaxation. Riding bikes gives me the thrill of adventure and freedom, and traveling allows me to explore new cultures and landscapes. I also find immense joy in reading books, which fuels my imagination and broadens my perspective. Music is a constant companion that helps me unwind and find inspiration, while trekking challenges me physically and connects me with nature. Each of these activities adds a unique dimension to my life, balancing my technical pursuits with personal growth and enjoyment.</p>
